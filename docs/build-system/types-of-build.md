# Build modes

The scaffold has four build modes:
- `dev` - runs the webpackdev server and watches for changes
- `build` - runs the build process once and outputs a static site
- `ci` - runs the build process once and outputs a static assets (not HTML) to a target folder
- `watch` - runs ci task and watches for changes 


## Dev
```
npm start
```

For developing a static site locally. The webpackdev server keeps files in memory, and hot reloads when it detects changes. Browsersync also runs to allow the devserver to be mirrored across devices.

By default the devserver runs on `localhost:8080`, and BrowserSync on `locahost:3000`. Read the console messages for output 

## Build
```
npm run build
```
To generate a static site. The build process runs once, and outputs a static site to a target folder.

## CI
```
npm run ci
```
To generate static assets for a server-rendered application. The build process runs once, and outputs static assets to a target folder specified by the `integrationOutput` variable in the `paths.config.js` file.

## Watch
```
npm run watch
```
For developing against a server-rendered application. The watch task runs the CI task and watches for changes.
