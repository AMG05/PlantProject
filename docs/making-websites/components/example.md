# Example component

The Example component in `src/templates/components/example` is demonstration-only, to document how you might create a fully-featured component with 
- multiple states in a single file - loading, empty, error, and success
- BEM CSS classNames
- Snapshot tests for each state in `src/templates/components/example/__tests__`
- Storybook stories for each state in `src/templates/components/example/index.stories.mdx`
